#Triangles can be classified based on their angles.

#A right triangle has one angle of 90째
#A obtuse triangle has one angle of more than 90째
#A triangle is acute if all three angles are less than 90째
#Write a program that asks the user for the values of three angles in degrees. First check if the entered values are valid. The values are only valid if they are >0 and if their sum is 180째. If the entered values are valid, classify the triangle as right, acute or obtuse.

#Below are two example executions of the program with invalid values:

#Please enter the first angle: 60
#Please enter the second angle: 60
#Please enter the third angle: 100
#The entered values are not valid.

#Please enter the first angle: 200
#Please enter the second angle: -10
#Please enter the third angle: -10
#Angles smaller than 0 are not valid.
#Here is another example execution of the program:

#Please enter the first angle: 60
#Please enter the second angle: 30
#Please enter the third angle: 90
#The triangle is a right triangle.
